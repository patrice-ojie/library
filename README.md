# Library Management System

## Description
This is a case study task that was set whilst enrolled as a student in a HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp.

### The Objective
In an effort to move away from their physical management system, the library wants a digital solution to manage book check outs and returns efficiently. You are tasked with creating this new system.

#### Installation

You can fork a copy of the code to use and amend as you see fit. Ensure that the books_inventory and users_info files are saved in the same folder as the python file in order for the code to work as is.
